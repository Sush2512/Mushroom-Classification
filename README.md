# Mushroom Toxicity Classification

## Summary
This project aims to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible using machine learning models. The dataset includes categorical features such as cap shape, cap color, and gill size. The primary goal is to develop a high-accuracy model that minimizes false negatives to ensure safety when identifying poisonous mushrooms.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn** (for data preprocessing and classification models)
- **LazyPredict** (for rapid model comparison)
- **Pandas**, **Numpy**

## Key Learnings
- Practiced data preparation techniques, including encoding categorical variables and handling missing data.
- Gained experience with model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with an emphasis on reducing false negatives.
- Enhanced understanding of model interpretability by analyzing feature importance in classification tasks.

## Challenges Overcame
- Effectively handled and encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.
- Evaluated and tuned multiple classification algorithms, ultimately selecting the ExtraTrees Classifier for its high accuracy and generalization capability on complex data.

## Additional Reflections
This project highlighted the importance of model selection in critical applications like toxicity prediction. LazyPredict proved valuable for efficiently comparing model performance, allowing for a focus on safety by selecting the most reliable classifier.
